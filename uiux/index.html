    <h1>Interface</h1>
    <img src="images/microwave.png" alt="a mockup image of the interface of a microwave" style="width: 60rem; height: 30rem;">
    <p>
      This interface is a microwave located in the kitchen of one of the department buildings on Brown campus. 
      This microwave is for users to quickly warm up their food in an efficient manner, allowing for minimal button presses. 
      It contains a bar for a user to open the microwave. It also contains various buttons. 
      The first buttons listed are preset buttpns such as Pizza or Popcorn that are tailored to warm up specific items.
      The next set of buttons is related to the settings of the microwave, such as the power level or the time on the clock.
      Then there is a number pad to allow the user to enter a specific time for their food. The numbers 1-6 are express cook so when
      a user presses one of them, it will automatically microwave for that amount of minutes, without requring a user to enter the full time. 
      There is also a start and stop button. </p>

<div id="interview" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>Interviews and Observations</h1>
    <h3>Key Observations</h3>

    <p>The main observations I found when observering users interacting with the microwave were:</p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>One general pattern across all users I observed using the microwave was that they all began by grabbing the handle on the microwave to open it, 
            then placed their item in the center of the microwave and stopped the microwave before the timer finished.</li>
        <li>The main difference I observed from user to user was the way they selected the amount of time to microwave their item. 
            One user used the start button to microwave their item for 30 seconds. Another user pressed the 1 express button and then 
            repeatedly pressed the start button to increment the time by 30 seconds with each press until they had the desired time. 
            Another user selected their time by simply using one of the express times and did not utilize the start button at all.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>What are you drawn to on the microwave?</li>
        <li>Do you utilize the shortcut buttons at the top when heating up specific items?</li>
        <li>Are there any buttons on the microwave that you find to have an unclear purpose?</li>
        <li>Are there any difficulties you had when using the microwave?</li>
        <li>How does this microwave compare to other microwaves you have used in the past? </li>
        <li>Are there any features that you would like for this microwave to have?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Summary of Responses</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Users said that they were drawn to the handle on the microwave. One user said that he was specifically drawn to the handle 
            because it is a lighter color than the rest of the microwave.</li>
        <li>Users do not utilize the buttons on the microwave aside from the number buttons and the start and clear buttons. In general the 
            shortcuts were not even acknowledged by users, and once they were acknowledged by the user, were often the source of confusion for them.</li>
        <li>When it came to difficulties while using the microwave, one user said that he didn’t have any difficulties while using the microwave but he felt that 
            he “wasn’t using it to its full potential”. Two users expressed difficulties with setting the microwave to cook for a specific amount of time and 
            only knew how to use the express buttons and the start button to increment by 30 seconds. One user was unsure if the kitchen timer or time cook button 
            was the way to go about this. </li>
        <li>When compared to other microwaves that they have used in the past, one user stated that they preferred another microwave they had used that did not have 
            the express cook buttons because they preferred manually entering the exact time to cook. Another user stated that they preferred that this microwave 
            has a bar to open it rather than a large button.</li>
        <li>When considering additional features for this microwave to have, one user stated that she would like if there was a touch screen for the buttons that allowed 
            a user to swipe through the different options rather than displaying all the buttons at once.</li>
    </ul>
